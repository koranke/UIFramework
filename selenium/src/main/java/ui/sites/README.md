# Sites
This package holds all website resources for all websites that need automation.  Each website needs to have its own
dedicated package.

## TestWebSite Template
"testweb" is provided as a starter template.  Copy this into a new package under the "sites" package and rename its
resources to reflect the actual website under test.  You will also need to add the new site to the TargetPortal enum.
