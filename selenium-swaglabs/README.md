## Cucumber Tests
This project has some additional demonstration code that shows the framework code in the context of BDD-style tests using
Cucumber.  See the "resources" directory for the feature files.
Step definitions are in the "steps" package under "src/main/java/saucedemo"
The TestNG equivalent tests can be found under
"src/test/java/swaglabs/regulartests".
